=================

A simple app displaying titles using Android development with Android Jetpack.

Libraries Used
--------------
* [Foundation][0] - Components for core system capabilities, Kotlin extensions and support for
  multidex and automated testing.
  * [Android KTX][2] - Write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.
  * [Test][4] - An Android testing framework for unit and runtime UI tests.
* [Architecture][10] - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and
  maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
  * [Data Binding][11] - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
  * [Lifecycles][12] - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
  * [LiveData][13] - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  * [Room][16] - Access your app's SQLite database with in-app objects and compile-time checks.
  * [ViewModel][17] - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule
     asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
  * [WorkManager][18] - Manage your Android background jobs.
* Third party and miscellaneous libraries
  * [Glide][90] for image loading focused on smooth scrolling and efficient caching.
  * [Ktor][94] - Ktor is built from the ground up using Kotlin and Coroutines. Very lightweight and promising library built by JetBrains.
  * [Hilt][92]: for [dependency injection][93]
  * [Kotlin Coroutines][91] for managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks
